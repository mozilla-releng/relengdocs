Cross-training
==============

Bus factor
==========

It's important to cross-train other team members, so no critical area of
knowledge has a singleton contributor. The team needs to provide coverage
during PTO, sick leave, timezones outside of the owner's working day.

Should we need focus time to finish an important project, other team members
can provide cover from interrupts, but only if we've written the documentation
and cross-trained the team.

Use cross-training to test documentation
========================================

Ideally, documentation can provide enough information and direction to
understand and fix problems without additional context. One way to check this
is to write the documentation with this in mind, then cross-train by pointing
the trainee at the documentation. You're available to answer questions and
clarify, but any needed clarification means the documentation may not be
complete or understandable. Update the docs with this new information.
