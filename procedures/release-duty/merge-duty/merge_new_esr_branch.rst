Merge Duty for major ESR bump
=============================

Intro
-----

This manual describes how to set up a new ESR branch. The same process
can be applied for any branch set up, with slight modifications.

Example tracking bug: `Bug 1717527 - tracking bug for build and release
of Firefox
91.0esr <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1717527>`__

Internal changes
----------------

For in-tree changes, grepping for the old `esrXX` (e.g. `on searchfox
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=esr91>`__) should be a good
starting point to figure out the necessary updates.  It can also be
useful to compare with the changes from the previous ESR bump.

Before the new build, rules should also be set up in balrog (stage and production):
- a rule with alias `firefox-esrXX-localtest` on the `esr-localtest*` channel
- a rule with alias `firefox-esrXX-cdntest` on the `esr-cdntest*` channel
- a rule with alias `esrXX` on the `esr` channel

The rules can initially point at the `No-Update` mapping and are then updated by automation.
Rules on the `esr-localtest-next` and `esr-cdntest-next` channels should be
adjusted so that updates to the new ESR are served (sometimes with a watershed
on the previous ESR, depending on app requirements; otherwise the rules for the
previous ESR can be changed to no longer apply to the `-next` channels).
Each `esrXX` rule's `Version` field should be set to `<XY.0` where `XY == XX+1`.

External systems
----------------

CI relies on multiple systems, supported by different teams. File bugs
in advance to make sure other teams have enough time to address the
issue. Usually starting the whole process 2 weeks in advance of release
builds (3 weeks before the release), gives enough time to everybody.

Tasks
-----

for the `tracking bug <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1717527>`__
look at each bug in the tree and see if it is needed in the next ESR.  Most likely it will be.

Odd problems
------------

mozilla-version needed an `update <https://github.com/mozilla-releng/mozilla-version/commit/3d9f3361505fbb485ea6103c2be6e2a8a4d41ec1>`__.
 * remember to push shipit changes that contain mozilla-version update to production branch, don't leave on master only
 * remember to update `treescript <https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/commit/d0ffb3c1c0095798c50e0f126e47280404b720ed>`__
 * remember to merge scriptworker-script (treescript) changes to production and let the ci-change bot complete

UVNEXT* tasks (update verify next) will fail (run in promote phase) unless proper balrog (esr-localtest-next) rule exists


Merge
-----

Merge release to esr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Run the ``m-r -> m-esrXX`` no-op trial run:

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: true
   behavior: release-to-esr
   push: true

2. The diff for ``esrXX`` should be fairly similar to 
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/075b0b573ba8b73514cb652d114fd1c00983fd0d>`__,
3. Submit a new task with ``force-dry-run`` set to false:

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: false
   behavior: release-to-esr
   push: true

:warning:
   It's not unlikely for the push to take between 10-20 minutes to complete.

Release builds
--------------

Make sure to run a staging release.
