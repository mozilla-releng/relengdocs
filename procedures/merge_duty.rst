MergeDuty
=========

All code changes to Firefox land in the
`mozilla-central <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central>`__ repository
while the Fennec counterpart land to
`mozilla-esr68 <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr68>`__.

* The ``nightly`` releases are built from that repo twice a day.
* DevEdition and Beta releases are built from the `beta <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/>`__ repository
* Extended Support Releases follow-up from the relevant ESR repo, such as `mozilla-esr68 <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr68/>`__
* Release and Release Candidates are built from `mozilla-release <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/>`__ repository

How are those repositories kept in sync? That's ``MergeDuty`` and is
part of the ``releaseduty`` responsibility.

Overview of Procedure
---------------------

``MergeDuty`` consists of multiple separate days of work. Each day you
must perform several sequential tasks. The days are spread out over
nearly three weeks, with *three* major days of activity:

-  Do the prep work a week before the merge

   -  `Set up mergeduty trello tracking
      board <#set-up-mergeduty-trello-tracking-board>`__
   -  `File tracking migration bug <#file-tracking-migration-bug>`__
   -  `Run staging releases <#run-staging-releases>`__
   -  `Access and setup the merge remote
      instance <#access-and-setup-the-merge-remote-instance>`__
   -  `Do migration no-op trial runs <#do-migration-no-op-trial-runs>`__
   -  `Sanity check no blocking migration
      bugs <#sanity-check-no-blocking-migration-bugs>`__
   -  `Land whatsnewpage list of
      locales <#land-whatsnewpage-list-of-locales>`__

-  On Merge day:

   -  `Merge beta to release <#merge-beta-to-release>`__
   -  `Reply migrations are
      complete <#reply-to-relman-migrations-are-complete>`__

-  A week after Merge day, bump mozilla-central:

   -  `Merge central to beta <#merge-central-to-beta>`__
   -  `Re-open trees <#re-opening-the-trees>`__
   -  `Run l10n bumper <#run-the-l10n-bumper>`__
   -  `Tag central and bump versions <#tag-central-and-bump-versions>`__
   -  `Bump mozilla-esr <#bump-esr-version>`__
   -  `Turn off merge
      instance <#turn-off-the-long-living-merge-instance>`__
   -  `Reply to RelMan that procedure is
      completed <#reply-to-relman-central-bump-completed>`__
   -  `Update wiki versions <#update-wiki-versions>`__
   -  `Bump Nightly version in ShipIt <#bump-nightly-shipit>`__

Historical context of this procedure:

Originally, the ``m-c`` -> ``m-b`` was done a week after ``m-b`` ->
``m-r``. Starting at ``Firefox 57``, Release Management wanted to ship
DevEdition ``b1`` week before the planned mozilla-beta merge day. This
meant Releng had to merge both repos at the same time. With 71.0, we're
back to the initial workflow with merging ``m-b`` -> ``m-r`` in the
first week and then ``m-c`` -> ``m-b`` in the follow-up week.

Do the prep work a week before the merge
----------------------------------------

Set up mergeduty trello tracking board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rather than extend Releasewarrior with more complexity, the idea here is
to try Trello and use Template cards for todo tracking.

To track human tasks and issues during merges, we use the following
`trello board <https://trello.com/b/AyyFAEbS/mergeduty-tasks>`__.

**First, ensure the board is clean**:

-  In the ``Merge Tasks`` list, select
   ``Archive all cards in this list``
-  Sanity check that all items in ``Postmortem Issues`` and
   ``Postmortem Action Items`` lists have been resolved then:

   -  In the ``Postmortem Issues`` list, select
      ``move all cards in this list`` to the
      ``Archived Postmortem Issues`` list
   -  In the ``Postmortem Action Items`` list, select
      ``move all cards in this list`` to the
      ``Archived Postmortem Action Items`` list

**Now prep the board for this cycle's planned merges**:

-  For each card in the ``Templates`` list, select the card then under
   Actions, choose ``Copy`` and put in the ``Merge Tasks`` list
-  For each newly copied card in the ``Merge Tasks`` list

   -  Add the people on mergeduty to the members list
   -  Set a deadline for each that correspond with the current `merge
      schedule <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=bW96aWxsYS5jb21fZGJxODRhbnI5aTh0Y25taGFiYXRzdHY1Y29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ>`__

**For each merge task**:

As you go through the steps documented below, update the checklists
within the cards under ``Merge Tasks``. This helps with hand-off and
tracking state.

As issues arise, add a card under the ``Merge Issues`` list. Associate
with bugs where appropriate. Use labels for issues. Each issue should
either be ``Resolved`` or ``Unresolved`` and some ``Resolved`` issues
may be also labeled as ``Future Threats``.

**For postmortems**:

After merge days, schedule a postmortem (or use current releaseduty
postmortem) and move all issues to the ``Postmortem Issues`` list.
During the postmortem, if any action items come up, track those in the
``Postmortem Action Items`` list.

File tracking migration bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File a tracking migration bug if there isn't one (e.g. `bug
1412962 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412962>`__)

Run staging releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to prepare a smooth ``b1`` and ``RC``, staging releases are to
be run in the week before the mergeduty day 1. In order for this to
happen, we're using `staging releases submitted to
try <https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/tools/try/selectors/release.html>`__.

**For central to beta migration**

-  hop on ``central`` repository
-  make sure you're up to date with the tip of the repo
-  ``mach try release --version <future-version.0b1> --migration central-to-beta --tasks release-sim``

**For beta to release migration**

-  hop on ``beta`` repository
-  make sure you're up to date with the tip of the repo
-  ``mach try release --version <future-version.0> --migration beta-to-release --tasks release-sim``

These will create try pushes that look-alike the repos once they are
merged. Once the decision tasks of the newly created CI graphs are
green, staging releases can be created off of them via the
`shipit-staging <https://shipit.staging.mozilla-releng.net/>`__
instance.

One caveat here is the list of partials that needs to be filled-in.
:warning: The partials need to exist in
`S3 <http://ftp.stage.mozaws.net/pub/firefox/releases/>`__ and be valid
releases in `Balrog
staging <https://balrog-admin-static-stage.stage.mozaws.net/>`__.

Ideally staging releases are triggered both on *Monday/Tuesday* but also
on *Thursday/Friday* to ensure that we're up to date with all the
patches that Sheriffs are landing before the ``RC`` week.

Once the staging releases are being triggered, it's highly recommended
that at least a comment is being dropped to Sheriffs team
(e.g. ``Aryx``) to let them know these are happening in order to: \*
avoid stepping on each others toes as they may run staging releases as
well \* make sure we're up-to-date to recent patches that they may be
aware of

:warning:
   Allow yourself enough time to wait for these staging releases
   to be completed. Since they are running in ``try``, they have the lowest
   priority even on the staging workers so it usually takes longer for them
   to complete.

Do migration no-op trial runs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doing a no-op trial run of each migration has one major benefit these
days: you ensure that the migrations themselves work prior to Merge day.

General steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Go to
   `Treeherder <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-beta>`__.
2. On the latest push, click on the down arrow at the top right corner.
3. Select “Custom push action…”
4. Choose ``merge-automation``

mozilla-beta->mozilla-release migration no-op trial run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Follow the `general steps <#general-steps>`__
2. Insert the following payload and click submit.

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: true
   behavior: beta-to-release
   push: true

mozilla-central->mozilla-beta migration no-op trial run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Follow the `general steps <#general-steps>`__
2. Insert the following payload and click submit.

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: true
   behavior: central-to-beta
   push: true

mozilla-esr bump no-op trial run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Follow the `general steps <#general-steps>`__
2. Insert the following payload and click submit.

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: true
   behavior: bump-esr
   push: true

Diff should be similar to `this
one <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr68/rev/bf17c381b0615fba955f8998c89593b103f32ba1>`__.

Sanity check no blocking migration bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the bug that tracks the migration has no blocking items.

Land whatsnewpage list of locales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TODO** - this needs to change, as the process no longer assumes this,
but apply them; the l10n drivers provide the final list of locales to
receive the WNP on the Tuesday prior to the ship date.

1. For each release, there should already be a bug flying around named
   ``Setup WNP for users coming from < X and receiving the X release``.
   Find it for the current release. e.g. `Bug
   1523699 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1523699>`__. We
   should always aim to chain this bug to our main mergeduty tracking
   bug. That is, block the WNP bug against the
   ``tracking XXX migration day``. If not already, please do so. This
   way, it's easier to find deps and navigate via bugs.
2. By the Friday prior to merge day, the l10n (most likely
   ``Peiying Mo [:CocoMo]``) team will have posted the final list of
   locales for whatsnewpage. Double-check with them again to make sure
   that is the final list. The list of locales comes in two forms:
   attachment in bug directly to be ``hg import``\ ed, but also as a
   comment. Make sure to double-check they match as that's generated
   automatically and sometimes there could be fallout resulting in
   mismatches.
3. Update the `in-tree whatsnewpage list of
   locales <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/browser/config/whats_new_page.yml>`__
   on central and request an uplift of that to beta. Similar to `this
   patch <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/55c218c9489b>`__.
   It will uplift to release when the merge happens on Monday

   1. On development machine, update
      ``browser/config/whats_new_page.yml`` with the list of locales
      from the bug
   2. Commit the change and create Phabricator patch request as usual
   3. Once the patch request is approved, land the patch via lando
   4. In Bugzilla edit the phabricator attachment and add a
      approval-mozilla-beta? flag similar to
      `this <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616636#c7>`__
   5. ensure someone from sheriffs or relman uplift this to Beta before
      Monday's merge and RC go-to-build

Release Merge Day - part I
--------------------------

**When**: Wait for go from relman to release-signoff@mozilla.com. Relman
might want to do the migration in two steps. Read the email to
understand which migration you are suppose to do, and then wait for
second email. For date, see `Release Scheduling
calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=bW96aWxsYS5jb21fZGJxODRhbnI5aTh0Y25taGFiYXRzdHY1Y29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ>`__
or check with relman

Merge beta to release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. `Close
   mozilla-beta <https://treestatus.mozilla-releng.net/static/ui/treestatus/show/mozilla-beta>`__.
   Check *“Remember this change to undo later”*. Please enter a good
   message as the reason for the closure, such as “Mergeduty - closing
   beta for $VERSION RC week”.
2. Run the ``m-b -> m-r`` `no-op trial
   run <#do-migration-no-op-trial-runs>`__ one more time, and show the
   diff to another person on releaseduty.
3. The diff for ``release`` should be fairly similar to
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/rev/0eae18af659f087056bce0f62a325e5e595fff72>`__,
   with updated the version change.
4. Submit a new task with ``force-dry-run`` set to false:

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: false
   behavior: beta-to-release
   push: true

:warning:
   It's not unlikely for the push to take between 10-20 minutes to complete.

:warning:
   If an issue comes up during this phase, you may not be able to run
   this command (or the no-op one) correctly. You may need to publicly
   backout some tags/changesets to get back in a known state.

1. Upon successful run, ``mozilla-release`` should get a version bump
   and branding changes consisting of a ``commit`` like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/rev/0eae18af659f087056bce0f62a325e5e595fff72>`__
   and a ``tag`` like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/rev/be8c618fd8ad921642e04e1552fbad46a044fe9e>`__
2. In the same time ``mozilla-beta`` should get a tag like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/d87f9b66ddd19a973ec3ef26a9163bab9383c438>`__
3. Verify changesets are visible on `hg
   pushlog <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/pushloghtml>`__
   and
   `Treeherder <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-release>`__.
   It may take a couple of minutes to appear.

:warning:
   The decision task of the resulting pushlog in the ``mozilla-release``
   might fail in the first place with a timeout. A rerun might solve
   the problem which can be caused by an unlucky slow instance.

Reply to relman migrations are complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reply to the migration request with the template:

.. code:: text

   This is now complete:
   * mozilla-beta is merged to mozilla-release, new version is XX.Y
   * beta will stay closed until next week

Release Merge Day - part II - a week after Merge day
----------------------------------------------------

**When**: Wait for go from relman to release-signoff@mozilla.com. For
date, see `Release Scheduling
calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=bW96aWxsYS5jb21fZGJxODRhbnI5aTh0Y25taGFiYXRzdHY1Y29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ>`__
or check with relman

Merge central to beta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Run the ``m-c -> m-b`` `no-op trial
   run <#do-migration-no-op-trial-runs>`__ one more time, and show the
   diff to another person on releaseduty.
2. The diff generated by the task should be fairly similar to
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/2191d7f87e2e>`__.
3. Submit a new task with ``force-dry-run`` set to false:

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: false
   behavior: central-to-beta
   push: true

:warning:
   It's not unlikely for the push to take between 10-20 minutes to complete.

1. Upon successful run, ``mozilla-beta`` should get a version bump and
   branding changes consisting of a ``commit`` like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/3656500a4581a9314e8ddc3558e411e02b874320>`__
   and a ``tag`` like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/3826424d7233604b53ce0fa9e87119abbaefa49d>`__
2. In the same time ``mozilla-central`` should get a tag like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/3cc678e923e6f105437db28740c8223fd4940c8d>`__
3. Verify changesets are visible on `hg
   pushlog <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/pushloghtml>`__
   and
   `Treeherder <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-beta>`__.
   It may take a couple of minutes to appear.

:warning:
   The decision task of the resulting pushlog in the ``mozilla-beta``
   might fail in the first place with a timeout. A rerun might solve
   the problem which can be caused by an unlucky slow instance.

Re-opening the tree(s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ask Sheriffs and RelMan to re-open trees (either ``open`` or
``approval-only``) so that l10n bumper can run.

Run the l10n bumper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run ``l10n-bumper`` against beta:

We now have automated cron jobs in Taskcluster to perform this step for
us. Trigger `this
hook <https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/hooks/project-releng/cron-task-releases-mozilla-beta%2Fl10n-bumper>`__
to run l10n bumper on ``mozilla-beta``. It takes a few min to run
because of the robustcheckouts, even though they are sparse. The job
queries Treestatus for trees status so it will **fail** if the trees are
still closed. It is safe to rerun in case of failure. It requires that
the mozilla-beta merge push is visible on the hg web-heads. So either
wait a few min after the ``m-c`` => ``m-b`` push step or verify it's
visible on
`mozilla-beta <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta>`__.

Tag central and bump versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**What happens**: A new tag is needed to specify the end of the nightly
cycle. Then clobber and bump versions in ``mozilla-central`` as
instructions depict.

1. Follow the `general steps <#general-steps>`__
2. Insert the following payload and click submit.

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: false
   push: true
   behavior: bump-central

1. Upon successful run, ``mozilla-central`` should get a version bump
   consisting of a ``commit`` like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b00860a2a28336267070c6fd882f0f5feabcebad>`__
   and a ``tag`` like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/0ab2bba66188606446c37868f4b01cdffebd0acc>`__
2. Verify changesets are visible on `hg
   pushlog <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml>`__ and
   `Treeherder <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-central>`__.
   It may take a couple of minutes to appear.

Bump ESR version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: You could have one ESR to bump, or two. If you are not sure, ask.

Run the bump-esr `no-op trial run <#do-migration-no-op-trial-runs>`__
one more time, and show the diff to another person on releaseduty.

Diff should be similar to `this
one <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr68/rev/2d43ffaa9d1adf29b71f0b7354374463c8d7b621>`__.

Push your changes generated by the no-op trial run:

1. Follow the `general steps <#general-steps>`__ - (As of 2020/04 this
   action hasn't yet been uplifted to release or esr68, consider using
   using ``mozilla-central``\ 's action, as the payload controls where
   the effects land)
2. Insert the following payload and click submit.

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: false
   push: true
   behavior: bump-esr

*Note* This is currently set to ``esr68``, the defaults can be
overridden in-tree in ``taskcluster/ci/config.yml`` or specified here as
using an action payload such as:

.. code:: yaml

   force-dry-run: false
   push: true
   behavior: bump-esr
   to-branch: esr78
   to-repo: https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr78

1. Upon successful run, ``mozilla-esr${VERSION}`` should get a
   ``commit`` like
   `this <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr68/rev/bf17c381b0615fba955f8998c89593b103f32ba1>`__.
2. Verify new changesets popped on
   https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr68/pushloghtml

Reply to relman central bump completed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reply to the migration request with the template:

.. code:: text

   This is now complete:
   * mozilla-central is merged to mozilla-beta, new version is XX.Y
   * mozilla-central has been tagged and version bumped
   * mozilla-esr has been version bumped
   * newly triggered nightlies will pick the version change on cron-based schedule

Update wiki versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Edit the new values manually:

-  `NEXT_VERSION <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Template:Version/Gecko/release/next>`__
-  `CENTRAL_VERSION <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Template:Version/Gecko/central/current>`__
-  `BETA_VERSION <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Template:Version/Gecko/beta/current>`__
-  `RELEASE_VERSION <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Template:Version/Gecko/release/current>`__
-  `Next release
   date <https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Template:NextReleaseDate>`__.
   This updates

   -  `The next ship
      date <https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Template:FIREFOX_SHIP_DATE>`__
   -  `The next merge
      date <https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Template:FIREFOX_MERGE_DATE>`__
   -  `The current
      cycle <https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Template:CURRENT_CYCLE>`__

Bump Nightly version in ShipIt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ShipIt currently hard-codes the version of Nightly that's being released.
It doesn't automatically updated because it would need to know when a
new nightly was available, not just when the version had been updated
in-tree. Everything up to merging this pull request can be done early,
but the PR must not be merged before the first nightly has been built
and published with the new version.

1. ``git clone git@github.com:mozilla-releng/shipit.git``
2. ``git checkout -b nightly_version_bump_${version}``
3. Edit FIREFOX_NIGHTLY's major version in
   https://github.com/mozilla-releng/shipit/blob/master/api/src/shipit_api/common/config.py#L48
4. Commit, and submit a pull request
5. Merge the pull request *after* a new nightly version has been pushed
   to CDNs
