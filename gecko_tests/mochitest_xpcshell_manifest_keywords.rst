Adding a keyword to mochitest and xpcshell manifests
====================================================

Keywords in mochitest and xpcshell test manifests allow us to determine which tests we want to skip and which we want to run.

Current behavior
----------------

Currently, gecko builds generate a ``target.mozinfo.json`` with metadata about the build. An example ``target.mozinfo.json`` might look like :download:`this <target.mozinfo.json>`. This lets us use ``skip-if`` in test manifests, like::

    skip-if = e10s && os == 'win'

In this case, ``e10s`` is a keyword. Keywords are essentially booleans in mozinfo, since we don't have to compare them to something like ``os == 'win'``.

The test will download the build's ``target.mozinfo.json``, then update the mozinfo dictionary with additional runtime information based on the task or runtime environment. This logic lives in `mozinfo <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/testing/mozbase/mozinfo/mozinfo/mozinfo.py>`__.

How to add a keyword
--------------------

The easiest route may be to patch `mozinfo <https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/mozbase/mozinfo.html>`__. For example, for Apple Silicon, we can add an ``apple_silicon`` keyword with a patch like this:
