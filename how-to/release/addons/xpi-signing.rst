XPI Signing Pipeline
====================

We support signing privileged webextensions and system addons in taskcluster,
through Shipit.

See the docs for `adding a new xpi <https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/xpi-manifest/blob/master/docs/adding-a-new-xpi.md>`__ and `releasing a xpi <https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/xpi-manifest/blob/master/docs/releasing-a-xpi.md>`__.
