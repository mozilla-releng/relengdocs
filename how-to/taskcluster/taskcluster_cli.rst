Taskcluster command line interface (CLI)
========================================

The Taskcluster Command Line Interface (CLI) source and docs are
`here <https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/main/clients/client-shell>`__.
Prebuilt Linux and Mac Taskcluster CLI binaries are available
`here <https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases>`__.

Difference between actions and CLI
----------------------------------

Taskcluster action hooks, as implemented in taskgraph, are one way to
perform similar tasks as the CLI, especially in regard to cancelling,
rerunning, or retriggering tasks.

They differ in a few ways:

1. You need a different set of scopes to trigger action hooks than to
   cancel, rerun, or retrigger tasks directly. For action hooks, you
   might need a scope like
   ``hooks:trigger-hook:project-gecko/in-tree-action-1-generic/*`` . For
   the CLI, you might need a scope like
   ``queue:rerun-task:gecko-level-1/*``

2. Actions use the logic supplied in ``taskgraph``. The CLI hits the
   Taskcluster API directly. Oftentimes this can result in similar
   behavior. But, for example, Github PRs from a non-privileged fork
   might not allow for rerunning, retriggering, or cancelling tasks
   through action hooks, while someone with scopes may be able to via
   the CLI.

   (A related point: permissions are more granular for action hooks; the
   CLI may allow for more broad access.)

3. Tasks generated through action hooks can be verifiable by the Chain
   of Trust (CoT). Tasks generated through, e.g.,
   ``taskcluster task retrigger -- TASKID`` are not. (This CLI call
   creates a new task without an action or decision task, which prevents
   CoT from verifying.)

   (Since a ``taskcluster task rerun -- TASKID`` doesn’t **generate** a
   new task but merely increments the ``runId``, that task should remain
   CoT-verifiable if it was CoT-verifiable originally.)

Taskcluster CLI best practices
------------------------------

Principle of Least Privilege
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We should follow the `principle of least
privilege <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege>`__.
Although Releng has effective root on the FirefoxCI cluster, let’s not
perform everyday actions using root privileges. Setting short expiries
and the minimal amount of scopes needed to perform a given task helps
avoid a) leaking scopes that can cause a lot of damage, and/or b)
accidentally running the wrong command in a shell and doing damage to
the production cluster.

Aliases
~~~~~~~

By setting aliases in our shells, we can perform common tasks without
having to memorize the syntax every time. Here are a few aliases that
may be helpful:

::

   # To set your root URL to the production firefoxci or stage cluster
   tc-fxci='export TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL=https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/'
   tc-staging='export TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL=https://stage.taskcluster.nonprod.cloudops.mozgcp.net'


   # To log out explicitly
   tc-logout='unset TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID; unset TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN'

   # Rerunning and cancelling tasks are a common request/need in releaseduty;
   # grant this set of scopes for 1 hour
   tc-relduty=$'eval $(taskcluster signin --expires 1h -s "queue:rerun-task:*\nqueue:cancel-task:*")'

   # Up to root privs: only grant these for 15min
   tc-signin='eval $(taskcluster signin --expires 15m "$@")'
