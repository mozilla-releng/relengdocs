Autograph
=========

We currently use `Autograph`_ to sign our files with a number of our signing
formats. Occasionally the autograph team will ask us to test to make sure
things are working properly.

Testing Autograph Stage
-----------------------

We currently use `Autograph`_ to sign our files with a number of our signing
formats. In CI, we point at autograph-prod, to avoid having autograph-stage
changes or availability affect production CI, nightlies, or releases.

However, sometimes the Autograph team needs to make changes to autograph-stage,
and want us to verify that it still works for us. Here's how.

Autograph-stage mar signing test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a tier 3 task that doesn't run automatically. This task,
``mar-signing-autograph-stage-linux64-nightly/opt``, can be added to a push
that has run nightly builds and repackage tasks.

With indexes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, go to `the latest Firefox desktop index <https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/index/gecko.v2.mozilla-central.latest.taskgraph/decision-nightly-desktop>`_. Click on ``View Task``. Click on ``Task Group`` at the top left to go to the taskgroup view.

Make sure you're signed in, then click on the three dots in the lower right hand corner. ``Add new jobs``. Add ``mar-signing-autograph-stage-linux64-shippable/opt`` to the list of tasks in the input so it looks like::

    tasks: [mar-signing-autograph-stage-linux64-shippable/opt]
    times: 1

Click ``Add new jobs`` in the lower left. Once the task finishes, click on the log. You'll see a line like::

    [task 2020-09-08T20:12:48.698Z] Creating task with taskId Z6FmfYVCRpOimAafnoziKQ for mar-signing-autograph-stage-linux64-shippable/opt

In which case, check task ``Z6FmfYVCRpOimAafnoziKQ`` for status. Report back to the bug.

With treeherder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, go to `mozilla-central treeherder`_. Make sure you're logged in
(top right).

Find the push with the most recent finished successful nightly. (It may be
easiest to search for ``nightly``).

On this push, click the down-arrow at the top right of the push. Choose
``Add new jobs``. The push will now show all the unscheduled jobs.

Find the autograph-stage mar-signing test job. It will be in the
``Linux x64 opt`` row, with the ``ms-stage(N)`` symbol. Click on it. It should
change colors to a dark grey.

Go back up to the top right of the push. Choose ``Trigger New Jobs``. Assuming
you've selected the right job, and you have the right scopes, it should now
create an ``add-new`` action task that triggers the autograph-stage mar-signing
task.

You can either watch treeherder or the taskcluster task. The task will be in
the on-push graph. The treeherder view may require you to enable ``tier 3``
in the ``Tiers`` menu at the top right of the page.

Once the ``mar-signing-autograph-stage-linux64-nightly/opt`` task goes green,
we know that autograph-stage has signed the mar, and signingscript has verified
that the signature matches the autograph-stage mar public key. Report back to
``#autograph`` on irc that it has passed.

Testing Autograph Prod
----------------------

Once we roll out to prod, we want to make sure everything still works.

.. _autograph-prod mar signing test:

Autograph-prod mar signing test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test autograph-prod mar-signing, find a recent (but ideally not the
most-recent) nightly graph. Find a mar-signing task in that graph.

To retrigger it via treeherder:

    - sign in to `mozilla-central treeherder`_ (top right of the page)
    - click on the task
    - find the ``...`` menu in the lower left of the page, click on it
    - choose ``Custom Action``
    - choose ``Retrigger``
    - click ``Trigger`` in the lower right

(A retrigger here is preferable to a rerun, because it won't affect chain of
trust verification for the rest of the graph.)

Make sure this task runs green. If it goes green, then the task signed the
mar file(s) via autograph-prod, and verified the signature matches the
public key.
